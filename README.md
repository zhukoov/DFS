Due to the bad network environment and some shitty bugs of my computer,
First we need to build a proxy to get through the firewall.
As for the shitty bugs, I need a file called "git.ignore" located in .git directory.
The content of which is as following:
`# Created by https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/windows
# Edit at https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore?templates=windows

### Windows ###
# Windows thumbnail cache files

Thumbs.db:encryptable
ehthumbs.db
ehthumbs_vista.db

# Dump file

# Folder config file

# Recycle Bin used on file shares
$RECYCLE.BIN/

# Windows Installer files
